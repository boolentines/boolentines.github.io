            <em>My dearest husband</em> (WHAT!!!):
            <br/>
            As always, words can't express how much it means to me
            to have the opportunity to share my life with you.
            <br/>
            I sat down to try to write you a letter, and I spent hours
            coming up with new ways of telling you how much I love you and
            how amazing you are. I really hope that someday my words will capture 
            the extent of my feelings
            for you. This time around, I am playing to my strengths.
            <br/>
            This little GIF I put together represents us and our life in
            our home, Chicago.
            <br/>
            I want us to keep <em>reencontr√°ndonos</em> again and again in Chicago.
            Let's keep filling each others hearts with love, warmth, patience, 
            and support. Just like the first time.
